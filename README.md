# Media-Center

For my embedded systems course, I had to create a media center using the Keil MCB1700 Evaluation Board and the µVision software. This media center features a photo gallery, an MP3 player, and a game. The media center interface is implemented on the LCD and users can navigate through the system using the MCB1700’s joystick.
